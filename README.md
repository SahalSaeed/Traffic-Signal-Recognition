# Traffic Sign Classification Using Classical Digital Image Processing

A complete implementation of traffic sign classification using only classical digital image processing techniques - no machine learning or pre-trained models involved.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end traffic sign classifier that operates entirely using classical image processing techniques. The system identifies traffic sign classes from cropped images using color, shape, and geometric features through a rule-based approach.

### Key Features
- **Classical DIP Only**: No machine learning - purely rule-based classification
- **Complete Pipeline**: From raw images to final classification results
- **Manual Implementation**: All algorithms implemented from scratch using NumPy
- **Multi-class Classification**: Handles 6-8 different traffic sign classes
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and confusion matrix analysis

## üöÄ Implementation Pipeline

### 1. **Image Preprocessing & Filtering**
- Mean Filter (3√ó3)
- Gaussian Filter with standard deviation
- Median Filter
- Adaptive Median Filter
- Unsharp Masking/High-Boost Filtering

### 2. **Color Space Conversion & Segmentation**
- Manual RGB to HSV conversion
- Color-based segmentation:
  - **Red signs**: Hue [0-15¬∞] or [165-180¬∞]
  - **Blue signs**: Hue [100-130¬∞]
- Morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening)
- Connected component filtering and hole filling

### 3. **Edge Detection**
- Complete Canny edge detection implementation:
  - Sobel gradient computation
  - Non-maximum suppression
  - Double thresholding and edge tracking

### 4. **Geometric Normalization**
- Affine transformations for rotation and scaling
- Perspective correction (optional)
- Standardization to 200√ó200 pixels

### 5. **Feature Extraction**
- **Corner Count**: Harris Corner Detection
- **Circularity**: C = 4œÄ√óArea/(Perimeter)¬≤
- **Aspect Ratio**: Width/Height of bounding box
- **Extent**: Region area to bounding box ratio
- **Average Hue**: Color feature extraction

### 6. **Rule-Based Classification**
- If-else decision tree using extracted features
- Color and shape feature combinations
- Handles visually similar signs (Stop vs. Yield)

## üìä Dataset Information

- **Classes**: 6-8 traffic sign categories
- **Images per Class**: ~100 images
- **Total Dataset**: 600-800 images
